MEAN Stack is a combination of the following components:
1.	MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows retrieval of data.
2.	Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
3.	Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
4.	Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user
